## Qualitative notes
The logistic regression head operates on Sentence-BERT embeddings; errors often occur when rhetorical style mixes multiple pramāṇa cues in one short span, or when implicit authority language appears without explicit attribution.

## Example failure cases (first few mislabels on test set)
1. **True:** `Pratyaksha` → **Predicted:** `Shabda`  
   - Text: "Bench notes (science): the sample fluoresced under UV immediately after staining."
2. **True:** `Pratyaksha` → **Predicted:** `Shabda`  
   - Text: "Bench notes (technology): the sample fluoresced under UV immediately after staining."
3. **True:** `Pratyaksha` → **Predicted:** `Shabda`  
   - Text: "Bench notes (education): the sample fluoresced under UV immediately after staining."
4. **True:** `Pratyaksha` → **Predicted:** `Shabda`  
   - Text: "Bench notes (medicine): the sample fluoresced under UV immediately after staining."
5. **True:** `Pratyaksha` → **Predicted:** `Shabda`  
   - Text: "Bench notes (politics): the sample fluoresced under UV immediately after staining."
6. **True:** `Pratyaksha` → **Predicted:** `Shabda`  
   - Text: "Bench notes (philosophy): the sample fluoresced under UV immediately after staining."

## Observations
- Hybrid fusion (`classification/hybrid_reasoning.py`) can stabilize borderline cases at inference time, but the supervised head still reflects whatever distribution is present in `nyaya_dataset.csv`.
- Composite strength (`reasoning_strength/composite.py`) intentionally decouples rhetorical strength from raw softmax peaks.
